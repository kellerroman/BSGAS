13.05.2017, RK:
   Start of project, using main parts from grid_adation.
07.06.2017, RK (Version V0.1)
   2D testcases: chamber, injector, o-grid, square work (can be read)
   2D is read, points with same coords are transfered to single point (not based on coordinate but on block connection)
   Edges adjecent to a wall are scaled to a given length
   Edges in line (+-1) are scaled not to differ in length more than a given factor
   issues: nozzle testcase leads to points outside of boundary
